This is my simple shell project, a fundamental 
requirement for the completion of sprint 1 in the Alx SWE programm.
I shall carefuly explain the concept as well as the syntax of how this shell works.

in an attempt to replicate the original unix shell,
this custom shell supports standard shell commands and behaviour, making it familiar to users.

You can: Execute commands, Navigate directories, Redirect input/output, Pipe commands.
Example of such usage are:

$ ls -l

$ cd /path/to/directory

$ echo "Hello, world!" > output.txt

$ cat input.txt | grep "keyword".

I hope to keep working on improving the shell to accepting and processing advance commands
and argument in the course of this project as follows:

use the PATH
implement built-ins
handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
be able to move the cursor
handle commands with arguments

I shall also update this readme file to keep you all updated.

Thank you.

Godwin Essien.
